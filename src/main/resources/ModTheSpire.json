  "description": "Adds the Administrix, a character mod for Slay the Spire. The lich princess of the rising sun, derived from the Touhou Project's Toyosatomimi no Miko, focuses heavily on themes of duality, synergy and deck manipulation. She currently has 77/80 cards, 8/11 relics, and 1/2 potions implemented, plus many new keywords. \n \n Available Languages: English, 简体中文\n  \n \n  ------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n v0.8.5 -> v0.9.2: Major content update. \n Duality has been removed, Affinity has been mostly folded into Yin and Yang, and there's numerous new cards + new relics. This is accompanied by UI improvements, plentiful custom effects and character animation, plus many drastic card revamps. The starting load-out and Common cards have been simplified, too.",
