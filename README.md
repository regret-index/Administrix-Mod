The _Administrix_, the lich princess of the rising sun,
is inspired by Toyosatomimi no Miko (豊聡耳 神子),
a character from the _Touhou Project_ series.

--== Instructions ==--
====== 

As with the other mods on the Steam Workshop, this mod requires subscribing to
both ModTheSpire and BaseMod first. 

For those using the older methods, the standard instructions still go as
follows:

 * Install ModTheSpire, if you haven't already.
   Latest release was available [here](https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases).
   Drop off the .jar in one's local directory for Slay The Spire,
   then create a mods folder in that same directory.
 * Install BaseMod, if you haven't already.
   Latest release was available [here](https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases).
   Drop off the .jar in the /mods/ folder.
 * Install this mod, by dropping off the .jar in the same folder.
 * Activate ModTheSpire (or MTS.CMD), then activate both the BaseMod
   and The Administrix in the menu before playing.

--== Summation ==--
======

This tricky card set focuses on themes of duality, synergy, and deck 
manipulation:

 * cards with effects on both drawing and discarding them,
 * many sources of Artifact to grasp onto transient power
   or brush off toxic side-effects,
 * and a manipulable duo of card fuel in Yin and Yang.
 
Side-themes include:

 * caring about card types played,
 * flexible card creation,
 * and swapping cards between one's hand, the Draw Pile, and the Discard Pile.

This v0.9 release contains 77 character-unique cards of a total planned 80,
plus nine relics out of a total planned eleven and one potion of two.

Design goals have been to make an internally consistent character, with decently
reliable representation and support for multiple interwoven deck archetypes
(Yin-focus vs Yang-focus vs balance; Artifact abuse; Plot abuse).
The Administrix readily uses multi-function cards plus flexible and enduring
defenses to constantly scale up from weaker base cards; playing her can start
out slow in understanding rather full cards, but she has many ways to gain many
buffs as she edges ever closer to becoming a legend.

--== New keywords ==--
======

For those who care about such, card spoilers follow here. This character's list
of keywords is definitely long and complicated enough to deserve this full
write-up, though, as a reference point. This is on the Github page too, after
all. (Note that spreadsheet links and copies of the StS extractor are attached
to each release, for those who wish to spoil themselves completely.)

==== __Plot__ ====

 * Cards with this have a __Plot__ effect on drawing them, the same effect on
   manually discarding them, and an entirely different effect on playing them.
   These are primarily defensive, in contrast to the Silent's utility focus
   and the Servant's offensive focus, though strong counterexamples still exist.
   Two 0-cost cards in the starting deck draw and discard on play, plus apply
   debuff effects through Plot.

== __Transpose__ ==

 * To __Transpose__ is to discard a card from the Draw Pile, then move a
   different card from the Discard Pile to the bottom of the Draw Pile. The
   starting relic provides a constant source of this, and so do a slim number
   of other cards. This triggers Plot effects too, though it's a trade of
   actively choosing such versus being able to trigger such later or twice
   whenever drawn.

== __Wilting__ ==

 * __Wilting__ is a self-inflicted debuff that (blockably) damages the player
   whenever they play a card. It is joined by Frail and two variations of Draw
   Reduction as the self-debuffs in this card set, and also vies for the use of
   one's own Artifact- transition rituals take a toll on the body, after all.

==== __Yin, Yang__ ====

 * __Yin and Yang__ are incidental benefits to many cards, scaling fuel for
   yet more cards, and constant benefits for a focused deck. If you have
   more Yin than Yang, then whenever you gain Yin, you'll gain block.
   If you have more Yang than Yin, then whenever you gain Yang, you'll
   deal damage to all enemies. 

== __Affinity__ ==

 * Affinity boosts the incremental benefits for both Yin and Yang.
   Some cards benefit heavily from raw numbers of Yin or Yang,
   some cards require building up both, and some cards simply
   combo well regardless of which alignment one thus takes.

== __Daybreaks, Nightfalls__ ==

 * These are 0-cost weak and Ethereal cards that Exhaust when played.
   __Daybreaks__ deal 3 (5) damage and also provide Yang, while __Nightfalls__
   gain 3 (5) block and also provide Yin. These scale strongly to Strength and
   Dexterity gain, can be played or ignored to balance for Duality and Affinity,
   plus readily help trigger the starting relic's conditions- these are well
   beyond Shivs. Be careful with playing these against Time Eater and the Heart!

...

--== Known Issues ==--
======

 * Playing cards too quickly can sometimes have tooltips or targetting arrows
   mess up the Transpose interface.
 * Both Blessings and Overdrive lack part of the Plot card indicator.
 * The in-game character statistics page prints a blank listing for the 
   character name.
 * Transcension's cards made flicker rapidly if the screen dims during the effect
   (e.g. Baton kicking in, any discard / exhaust prompts).
 * Card preview tooltips would be nice for Choose Your End and Bloodsoaked Veil,
   though the two cards each pose a number of issues.

--== Full Release Plans ==--
======
 * Cleaner Yin and Yang UI.
 * The remaining cards (more utility and scalars), relics (Possibly another
   boss relic, defintiely another rare), another potion
 * An event or two.   
 * Special effects for capturing spell cards.
