== v0.8.4c ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Conductor's Ritual Baton now activates as it should on playing 3 of one, 3
    of another, then 1 of the original card type.
  * Hope In The Dark(+) properly applies Frail and Dexterity to its base effect.
  * Mastermind's power tooltip is fixed for having more than 2 stacks of it.
  * Cast Off Regrets now triggers properly with Quiet Conspiracy's discard.
 - Balance
  * Amassed Masks: 3 -> 2 cost. Amassed Masks+: gives upgraded cards.
  * Amassed Masks(+): can't generate itself.
  * Seal Away+: Draws 3 -> 4 cards.
  * Seventeen Article Laser+: Gain 17 of the lower of your Yin / Yang ->
    Deal damage to all enemies.
  * Cast Off Regrets(+): 2 -> 3 Frail.
  * Overdrive: No longer gives 1 energy. Overdrive+: Now gives -1 Strength.
 - Effects
  * Mastermind now has a blue flash border, not a red one, to avoid associations
    with taking low-HP damage.
 - Text
  * Wuji+ properly lists Retain when it'd do something / is used / is discarded.
  * Upgraded Immortal cards have their Plot effects rephrased.
  * Regent's Edict emphasizes that it steals _all_ of the enemy's strength.
  * Cracking Pangu, Newborn Divinity, and Hope In The Dark all emphasize that
    it removes the user's debuffs, and not other targets'.

== v0.8.3 ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Attack / Skill Counter relic addition no longer overrides
    relics when either is repositioned with relic sorter mods.
 - Balance
  * Unstable Vigor now gives Wilting at the end,
    so a single source of Artifact will keep the Strength
    (rather than just prevent the Wilting).
  * Unstable Vigor(+): 11 -> 12 (12 -> 14) damage.
  * Mastermind(+) both lose Retain, but now both cost 1.
  * Grandeur(+): 1/1 -> 2/2 Strength/Dexterity (2/2 -> 3/3 Strength / Dexterity)
 - Cards
  * Hope In The Dark and its upgraded version no longer calculate off the
    other version's multiplier in the description.
  * Duality now properly keeps track of Attacks and Skills played during the
    turn in its power tooltip.
  * Wife's Lightning and Faithful Flames now keep track of how many Attacks
    they'll take before they activate.
 - Text
  * Strike, Defend, Attunement Tonic, the three Immortal cards,
    Character select screen, Heart event, and Vampires event text all adjusted
    to support future localization.
