== v0.8.5b ==
Some new cards might be coming soon.
The Simplified Chinese translation is also being whittled away at-
additional proofreaders welcome.
 - Bug fixes
  * Lifeforce Net reverses the order of the random attack and attack-all,
    so that the random attack doesn't randomly fail if an enemy dies to the
    attack-all.
 - Balance
  * Attunement Tonic: Completely revamped.
    If one has any Affinity, gain 3 more; if one has any Duality, gain 3 more.
  * Dusk and Dawn: Upgraded Daybreak / Nightfall. Dusk and Dawn+: Draw 2.
  * Immortal Grace: Base 6 -> 7 damage.
  * Immortal Purity: Base 6 -> 7 block.
  * Wicked Punishment+: Gain 4 Yin twice -> Gain 3 Yin thrice.
  * Grandeur(+): 2 Dexterity -> 1 (3 Dexterity -> 2), no longer exhausts
    and is no longer Innate.
  * Katabasis(+): Applies 1 Weak X(+1) times, instead of applying X(+1) Weak.
  * Wuji retains. Wuji+ cuts one's Yin & Yang in half. Wuji/+ both cost 1.
  * Harmonic Reverence(+): 4 -> 3 Affinity (5 -> 4 Affinity).
 - Effects
  * Transpose now makes the screen flash gold and plays sound effects for
    either half's menu, hopefully helping one identify the screen suddenly
    popping up from the Shaku or Mayhem.
  * False Death has its own sound effect, too.
  - Ten Desires and Mastermind no longer have unique effects, due to the above.
    This'll be fixed later.
  * New Wardrobe and Seventeen Article Laser no longer show their
    individual-target effects on dead monsters.
  * New Wardrobe's effects fix their reversed logic and have adjusted colours.
 - Text
  * Using False Death+ properly states that it grabs three cards, not two.
  * Fixed New Wardrobe+ not showing the flat bonus when in hand.

== v0.8.4c ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Conductor's Ritual Baton now activates as it should on playing 3 of one, 3
    of another, then 1 of the first card type.
  * Hope In The Dark(+) properly applies Frail and Dexterity to its base effect.
  * Mastermind's power tooltip is fixed for having more than 2 stacks of it.
  * Cast Off Regrets now triggers properly with Quiet Conspiracy's discard.
 - Balance
  * Amassed Masks: 3 -> 2 cost. Amassed Masks+: gives upgraded cards.
  * Amassed Masks(+): can't generate itself.
  * Seal Away+: Draws 3 -> 4 cards.
  * Seventeen Article Laser+: Gain 17 of the lower of your Yin / Yang ->
    Deal damage to all enemies.
  * Cast Off Regrets(+): 2 -> 3 Frail.
  * Overdrive: No longer gives 1 energy. Overdrive+: Now gives -1 Strength.
 - Effects
  * Mastermind now has a blue flash border, not a red one, to avoid associations
    with taking low-HP damage.
 - Text
  * Wuji+ properly lists Retain when it'd do something / is used / is discarded.
  * Upgraded Immortal cards have their Plot effects rephrased.
  * Regent's Edict emphasizes that it steals _all_ of the enemy's strength.
  * Cracking Pangu, Newborn Divinity, and Hope In The Dark all emphasize that
    it removes the user's debuffs, and not other targets'.

== v0.8.3 ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Attack / Skill Counter relic addition no longer overrides
    relics when either is repositioned with relic sorter mods.
 - Balance
  * Unstable Vigor now gives Wilting at the end,
    so a single source of Artifact will keep the Strength
    (rather than just prevent the Wilting).
  * Unstable Vigor(+): 11 -> 12 (12 -> 14) damage.
  * Mastermind(+) both lose Retain, but now both cost 1.
  * Grandeur(+): 1/1 -> 2/2 Strength/Dexterity (2/2 -> 3/3 Strength / Dexterity)
 - Cards
  * Hope In The Dark and its upgraded version no longer calculate off the
    other version's multiplier in the description.
  * Duality now properly keeps track of Attacks and Skills played during the
    turn in its power tooltip.
  * Wife's Lightning and Faithful Flames now keep track of how many Attacks
    they'll take before they activate.
 - Text
  * Strike, Defend, Attunement Tonic, the three Immortal cards,
    Character select screen, Heart event, and Vampires event text all adjusted
    to support future localization.

== v0.8.2 ==
 * Changelog started.
 * Bug fixes: Transpose activating post-combat clear,
   graphics crashes with sufficiently strong New Wardrobes,
   on playing Death By Glamour+.
 * Phrasing and typos: Wilting's description mentions block,
   Baton spells "Transpose" properly.

 * Diversion Tactic: 5 -> 7 damage. Diversion Tactic+: 8 damage -> 10 damage.
 * New Wardrobe+: Loses Retain, instead does an extra flat 4 damage.
