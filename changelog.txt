==== v0.9.1a ====
=======
 - Two new cards.
  * Funerary Rites: A 1(0)-cost common skill.
    Discard 1 card. Put a card from your Discard Pile on top of your Draw Pile.
    Gain 4 Yang.
  * Trick of the Light: A 1 cost common attack.
    Deal 8 damage. Discard the top Plot card in your draw pile.
    Gain 4 Yin. Exhaust (not).

 - Simplification revisions: Duality has been cut.
   The following previous sources of it have been revamped:
  * Metempsychosis: Now a 1(0) cost uncommon skill.
    Put a card from your draw pile on top of your draw pile.
    Gain 1 energy and draw 1 less card next turn.
  * Wuji: Now a 1(0)-cost uncommon power.
    Gain 1 Dexterity for each 5 of the lower of your Yin and Yang.
    Lose half of your Yin and Yang. Retain.
  * Overdrive: Now a 0-cost uncommon skill.
    Unplayable. { Plot: Gain [E]. Gain 3(4) Strength.
    Lose 5(6) Strength at the end of the turn. Exhaust. }
  * Xian Arts: now a 2(1)-cost uncommon power.
    Ethereal (not). Whenever you gain any Artifact,
    gain 1 Strength and 1 Dexterity.
  * Star Sword Soul: Still a 3-cost rare power.
    (Innate.) At the start of each turn, gain 1 Affinity
    and draw 1 additional card. Retain.
  * Attunement Tonic: Still an uncommon potion.
    If you have any Affinity, gain 3 more.

 - Simplification revisions - Yin and Yang no longer slowly equalize,
   and have Affinity effects built-in for both (at an effective base 1).
   Affinity now simply strengthens Yin and Yang.
   Hidden Power is out of the starting deck and is now Uncommon:/
   [0-cost power - Gain 1(2) Affinity. Draw 1 less card next turn.]

 - Balance changes, due to the above shifts.
  * Red Cloak: 3(5) Block -> 2(4) Block.
  * Blue Cloak: 3(5) damage -> 2(4) damage.
  * Syncretic Surge, Syncretic Plunge: Common -> Uncommon.
  * Touch of Cinnabar: Base provides 2 Armor, upgrade provides 4 and costs 1.
  * Beget Eternity: 2(3) Affinity -> 2(3) Strength.
  * Choose Your End: 11(15) damage -> 10(14) damage.
  * Just Rewards: 2(3) Daybreaks -> 2 Daybreak(+)s.
  * Wicked Punishment: 3 Yin twice (thrice) -> 3 (4) Yin twice.
  * Bishamon's Blessing, Guanyin's Blessing:
    Base card Plot effects draw 1 card, base cards exhaust when drawn.
  * Cosmos Control: Uncommon -> Rare.
  * Untouchable: 3(4) Dexterity -> 2(3) Dexterity.
  * Cast Off Regrets: 3 Frail -> 2 Frail twice.
 ...
  * Elixir of Immorality: 1 Frail Turn 4 -> 2 Frail Turn 4.
 ...
  * Light of Your Life: Base no longer exhausts, upgrade costs 0.
  * Feast of Dew: Base now exhausts and adds a copy to the Draw Pile.

 - Bugfixes:
  * Cosmos Control properly applies the discount to the retrieved card
    when there's only 1 card in the discard pile.
  * Base Transcension displays the proper division point in-hand
    for being able to play an attack twice or more.
 - Visuals
  * New card art edits for Reach to Heaven, Unstable Vigor, and Mix of Mercury.

    Wicked Punishment, Feast of Dew, and Guanyin's Blessing:
    all have altered card art.
  * Luminary's Path and Conductor's Ritual Baton now have sound effects.
 - Text
  * Would much rather have italics or just lean on the fact that multiple
    enemies consistently means "all", but to match base game English card copy
    all uses of "all enemies" is now consistently "ALL enemies".
  * Likewise, Seal Away is now consistent with Armaments, and
    Unstable Vigor + Untouchable are now consistent with Flex.
  * "your Yin and your Yang" is now consistently "your Yin and Yang".
  * Plot's tooltip is pluralized for Mastermind.

== v0.8.5b ==
The Simplified Chinese translation is also being whittled away at-
additional proofreaders welcome.

    so that the random attack doesn't randomly fail if an enemy dies to the
    attack-all.

 - Balance

  * Harmonic Reverence(+): 4 -> 3 Affinity (5 -> 4 Affinity).
 - Visuals & Effects
  * Transpose now makes the screen flash gold and plays sound effects for
    either half's menu, hopefully helping one identify the screen suddenly
    popping up from the Shaku or Mayhem.
  * False Death has its own sound effect, too.
  - Ten Desires and Mastermind no longer have unique effects, due to the above.
    This'll be fixed later.

  * Mastermind's power tooltip is fixed for having more than 2 stacks of it.

    with taking low-HP damage.
 - Text

  * Upgraded Immortal cards have their Plot effects rephrased.
  * Regent's Edict emphasizes that it steals _all_ of the enemy's strength.
  * Cracking Pangu, Newborn Divinity, and Hope In The Dark all emphasize that
    it removes the user's debuffs, and not other targets'.

== v0.8.3 ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Attack / Skill Counter relic addition no longer overrides
    relics when either is repositioned with relic sorter mods.
 - Balance
  * Unstable Vigor now gives Wilting at the end,
    so a single source of Artifact will keep the Strength
    (rather than just prevent the Wilting).

    Character select screen, Heart event, and Vampires event text all adjusted
    to support future localization.

   graphics crashes with sufficiently strong New Wardrobes,
