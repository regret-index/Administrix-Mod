== v0.8.4b ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Conductor's Ritual Baton now activates as it should on playing 3 of one, 3
    of another, then 1 of the original card type.
  * Hope In The Dark(+) properly applies Frail and Dexterity to its base effect.
  * Mastermind's power tooltip is fixed for having more than 2 stacks of it.
  * Cast Off Regrets now triggers properly with Quiet Conspiracy's discard.
 - Balance
  * Seal Away+: Draws 3 -> 4 cards.
 - Effects
  * Mastermind now has a blue border, not a red one, to avoid associations
    with taking low-HP damage.
 - Text
  * Upgraded Immortal cards have their Plot effects rephrased.
  * Regent's Edict emphasizes that it steals _all_ of the enemy's strength.
  * Cracking Pangu, Newborn Divinity, and Hope In The Dark all emphasize that
    it removes the user's debuffs, and not some target's.

== v0.8.3 ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Attack / Skill Counter relic addition no longer overrides
    relics when either is repositioned with relic sorter mods.
 - Balance
  * Unstable Vigor now gives Wilting at the end,
    so a single source of Artifact will keep the Strength
    (rather than just prevent the Wilting).
  * Unstable Vigor(+): 11 -> 12 (12 -> 14) damage.
  * Mastermind(+) both lose Retain, but now both cost 1.
  * Grandeur(+): 1/1 -> 2/2 Strength/Dexterity (2/2 -> 3/3 Strength / Dexterity)
 - Cards
  * Hope In The Dark and its upgraded version no longer calculate off the
    other version's multiplier in the description.
  * Duality now properly keeps track of Attacks and Skills played during the
    turn in its power tooltip.
  * Wife's Lightning and Faithful Flames now keep track of how many Attacks
    they'll take before they activate.
 - Text
  * Strike, Defend, Attunement Tonic, the three Immortal cards,
    Character select screen, Heart event, and Vampires event text all adjusted
    to support future localization.

== v0.8.2 ==
 * Changelog started.
 * Bug fixes: Transpose activating post-combat clear,
   graphics crashes with sufficiently strong New Wardrobes,
   on playing Death By Glamour+.
 * Phrasing and typos: Wilting's description mentions block,
   Baton spells "Transpose" properly.

 * Diversion Tactic: 5 -> 7 damage. Diversion Tactic+: 8 damage -> 10 damage.
