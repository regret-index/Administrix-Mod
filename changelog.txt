== v0.8.3 ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Attack / Skill Counter relic addition no longer overrides
    relics when either is repositioned with relic sorter mods.
 - Balance
  * Unstable Vigor now gives Wilting at the end,
    so a single source of Artifact will keep the Strength
    (rather than just prevent the Wilting).
  * Unstable Vigor(+): 11 -> 12 (12 -> 14) damage.
  * Mastermind(+) both lose Retain, but now both cost 1.
  * Grandeur(+): 1/1 -> 2/2 Strength/Dexterity (2/2 -> 3/3 Strength / Dexterity)
 - Cards
 * Hope In The Dark and its upgraded version no longer calculate off the
   other version's multiplier in the description.
 * Duality now properly keeps track of Attacks and Skills played during the
   turn in its power tooltip.
 * Wife's Lightning and Faithful Flames now keep track of how many Attacks
   they'll take before they activate.
.
Localization
 * Strike, Defend, Attunement Tonic, the three Immortal cards,
   Character select screen, Heart event, and Vampires event text all adjusted
   to support future localization.
