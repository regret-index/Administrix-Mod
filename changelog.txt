 - Bug Fixes
  * Unstable Vigor no longer exhausts, as the card text didn't mention. Whoops.
 - Balance
  * Dusk and Dawn has been removed.

  * Rising Sun's Prince: 3(4) * 2 damage to all -> 4(6) * 2 damage to one.

  .

  * Base Schism doesn't exhaust. Schism+ costs 0.
  * Mastermind's doubled-Plot is now before, not after the Transpose.
  * Ten Desires+: Not Ethereal -> Doesn't exhaust.
 - Visuals & Effects
  * The Transpose border effect now lasts a bit longer.
  * Fiendish Crimson now gnaws with a proper red.
  * Regent's Edict, Seal Away, Syncretic Surge & Plunge, Rising Sun's Prince,
    Unstable Vigor, Wicked Punishment, and Guanyin's Blessing all have altered
    card art.
  * Luminary's Path now has a sound effect.
 - Text
  * Would much rather have italics or just lean on the fact that multiple
    enemies consistently means "all", but to match base game English card copy
    all uses of "all enemies" is now consistently "ALL enemies".
  * Likewise, Seal Away is now consistent with Armaments, and
    Unstable Vigor + Untouchable are now consistent with Flex.
  * "your Yin and your Yang" is now consistently "your Yin and Yang".
  * Plot's tooltip is pluralized for Mastermind.

== v0.8.5b ==
The Simplified Chinese translation is also being whittled away at-
additional proofreaders welcome.
 - Bug fixes
  * Lifeforce Net reverses the order of the random attack and attack-all,
    so that the random attack doesn't randomly fail if an enemy dies to the
    attack-all.
  * Overdrive's reversed energy-gain logic is set back to normal.
 - Balance
  * Attunement Tonic: Completely revamped.
    If one has any Affinity, gain 3 more; if one has any Duality, gain 3 more.
  * Dusk and Dawn: Upgraded Daybreak / Nightfall. Dusk and Dawn+: Draw 2.
  * Immortal Grace: Base 6 -> 7 damage.
  * Immortal Purity: Base 6 -> 7 block.
  * Wicked Punishment+: Gain 4 Yin twice -> Gain 3 Yin thrice.
  * Grandeur(+): 2 Dexterity -> 1 (3 Dexterity -> 2), no longer exhausts
    and is no longer Innate.
  * Katabasis(+): Applies 1 Weak X(+1) times, instead of applying X(+1) Weak.
  * Wuji retains. Wuji+ cuts one's Yin & Yang in half. Wuji/+ both cost 1.
  * Harmonic Reverence(+): 4 -> 3 Affinity (5 -> 4 Affinity).
 - Visuals & Effects
  * Transpose now makes the screen flash gold and plays sound effects for
    either half's menu, hopefully helping one identify the screen suddenly
    popping up from the Shaku or Mayhem.
  * False Death has its own sound effect, too.
  - Ten Desires and Mastermind no longer have unique effects, due to the above.
    This'll be fixed later.
  * New Wardrobe and Seventeen Article Laser no longer show their
    individual-target effects on dead monsters.
  * New Wardrobe's effects fix their reversed logic and have adjusted colours.
 - Text

  * Fixed New Wardrobe+ not showing the flat bonus when in hand.

== v0.8.4c ==
 - Bug fixes

    of another, then 1 of the first card type.
  * Hope In The Dark(+) properly applies Frail and Dexterity to its base effect.
  * Mastermind's power tooltip is fixed for having more than 2 stacks of it.
  * Cast Off Regrets now triggers properly with Quiet Conspiracy's discard.

  * Seventeen Article Laser+: Gain 17 of the lower of your Yin / Yang ->
    Deal damage to all enemies.
  * Cast Off Regrets(+): 2 -> 3 Frail.
  * Overdrive: No longer gives 1 energy. Overdrive+: Now gives -1 Strength.
 - Visuals
  * Mastermind now has a blue flash border, not a red one, to avoid associations
    with taking low-HP damage.
 - Text
  * Wuji+ properly lists Retain when it'd do something / is used / is discarded.
  * Upgraded Immortal cards have their Plot effects rephrased.
  * Regent's Edict emphasizes that it steals _all_ of the enemy's strength.
  * Cracking Pangu, Newborn Divinity, and Hope In The Dark all emphasize that
    it removes the user's debuffs, and not other targets'.

== v0.8.3 ==
 - Bug fixes
  * Attack / Skill Counter relic addition no longer overrides
    relics when either is repositioned with relic sorter mods.
 - Balance
  * Unstable Vigor now gives Wilting at the end,
    so a single source of Artifact will keep the Strength
    (rather than just prevent the Wilting).
  * Unstable Vigor(+): 11 -> 12 (12 -> 14) damage.
  * Mastermind(+) both lose Retain, but now both cost 1.

    turn in its power tooltip.

    they'll take before they activate.
  * Strike, Defend, Attunement Tonic, the three Immortal cards,
    Character select screen, Heart event, and Vampires event text all adjusted
    to support future localization.

   graphics crashes with sufficiently strong New Wardrobes,
   on playing Death By Glamour+.
